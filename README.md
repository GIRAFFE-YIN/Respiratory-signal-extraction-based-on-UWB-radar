# Respiratory-signal-extraction-based-on-UWB-radar
This research will explore the use of the coherent XeThru X4 IR-UWB radars, developed by Novelda, for unobtrusive sensing of human behaviour and physiology. The research will start with the extraction of basic vital signs and will gradually be extended to monitoring the patient's daily behaviour and identifying dangerous situations.
